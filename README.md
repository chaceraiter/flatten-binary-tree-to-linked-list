# flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list

This is a problem from LeetCode.com that I thought was particularly interesting

The problem description is not fleshed out in that it doesn't describe whether the linked list has to be in any order.

My initial attempts to solve the problem resulted in a flattened list that was linked in the incorrect order.

Manually traversing the flattened list to insert values in order would be computationally intensive.

I found on switching around my search order that things printed in the correct order to pass the problem's test cases
